## My process

Started by using HTML to give the structure of the layout and having the CSS styling in mind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt to visualize my solutions first before coding it out. After taking my time to analyse the figma file and the image preview of the expected solution then i dived first with building the structure of the layout with HTML.

In the HTML i made use of a div with the class name of .main to hold to hold a single div with the class name of .container that serves as parent to the images and contents. The reason for this approach is to achieve a similar look to the expected result, i was able to center the .container div and also add the CSS box shadow property.

Also discovered new ways to reduce font size in css without neccessarily using media queries, i made use of the viewport units.


### Continued development

Hopefully, as time goes on i will get to learn about more on accessibility, because while thinking about it, i realized how essential it is to follow a top accessibility and HTML semantic approach to help with all kinds of users trying to access our websites and web apps.
