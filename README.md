## My process

Started by using HTML to give the structure of the layout and having the CSS styling in mind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt to visualize my solutions first before coding it out. After taking my time to analyse the image preview of the expected solution then i dived first with building the structure of the layout with HTML.

In my HTML file, i started by using the main tag and then using a div with the class name of .main which is a parent to another div with the class name of .container. The reason for this procedure is to center the div and its children elements.

The .container div is a parent to the rest of the contents like the image and anchor tags used for the profile links. 

Heading to the CSS file, i started with the css reset and then giving the appropriate styles to achieve a similar out as the expected image preview. I tried using a simple approach so my code is self explanatory or at least easy to follow up.



### Continued development

Hopefully, as time goes on i will get to learn about more on accessibility, because while thinking about it, i realized how essential it is to follow a top accessibility and HTML semantic approach to help with all kinds of users trying to access our websites and web apps.
